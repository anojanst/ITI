                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The International Training Institute embarked its journey by its founder Mr. Sentheyval on March 1999 at Ori Lavi Haus in Boroko, NCD. In our first batch fewer than 30 students begin their journey and we had 01 computer lab for them. </p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Since then ITI grown its branches, enlarged their vision to cater professional and human capacity development of Papua New Guinean youngsters. As a leading private institute in Papua New Guniea our institution given full institutional accreditation with the Commission of Higher Education in May 2014.  The accreditation has been granted after 5 years of audits and reviews by the commission.  This has been one of ITIâ€™s greatest achievements from moving from an institute to a higher education provider.</p>
